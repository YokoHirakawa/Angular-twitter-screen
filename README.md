# angular-twitter-screen

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.2.1.

This is a recreation of my Django-twitter-screen project using Angular.
My first Django app that connects to my Twitter API:

* Show the list of tweets with the given hashtag
* Show the list of tweets that user has on his feed

## Installation

Run  `npm install` for dependency installation.

NOTE: You also need my python-twitter API running on the same server

http://www.github.com/yokohirakawa/python-twitter-api/

## Usage

Run `ng serve` for a dev server, and go to any of the following:

http://127.0.0.1:4200/
http://127.0.0.1:4200/user/
http://127.0.0.1:4200/hashtag/

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
